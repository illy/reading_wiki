        <p><strong>Median</strong>: the score divides each set of scores into two nearly equal subgroups; one of these contains all the scores less than the median, the other all those greater than the median.</p>
<p>Although we will require little knowledge of mathematics other than simple arithmetic, the use of some basic mathematical notations is, in the end, and aid to clear argument and results in a great saving in space.</p>
<p>One would say that the median is a robust indicator of the more typical values of the data, being unaffected by the occasional atypical value which might occur at one or other extreme.</p>
<p>A dataset is said to be <strong>skewed</strong> of the highest point of its histogram, or bar chart, is not in the centre, hence causing one of the 'tails' of the diagram to be longer than the other.</p>
<p>The most frequent value is called the <strong>model value</strong> or <strong>mode</strong>.</p>
<p>For reasons which will soon become clear, it becomes a habit to assume that, unless otherwise indicated, a data set is <em>roughly symmetrical</em> and <em>bell-shaped</em>.</p>
<p>It is generally good practice to avoid, as far as possible, collecting data in such a way that we have less information about some subjects in the study than we have about others.</p>
<p>At this point we should note that it may sometimes be <em>inappropriate</em> to take simple average of percentages and proportions.</p>
<p><strong>You should think carefully about the meaning of the data and have a clear understanding of what it is you are trying to measure</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Weighted mean score</strong>: the score for the individual parts of the examination are no longer given equal weights.</p>
<p>It sometimes occurs that published data are presented only as proportions or percentages without the original values being given. This is a serious error in percentages since, it often prevents analysis of the data by another researcher.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the two means are similar in value, or the medians are, this will not usually be sufficient evidence for the statement that the complete sets of scores have a similar overall shape or structure.</p>
<p>It is therefore usual to measure (and report) the degree to which a group lacks homogeneity, i.e. the variability, or dispersion, of the scores about the average value.</p>
<p>The extent of variability, or heterogeneity if you like, in a population is the main determinant of how well we can generalize to that population the characteristics we observe in a sample.</p>
<p><strong>The more variability, the greater will be the sample size required to obtain a given quality of information</strong>.</p>
<p>How can we indicate numerically the difference in the spread of marks?</p>
<p>One way is by means of intervals centered on the median value and containing a stated percentage of the observed data values.</p>
<p><strong>50% central interval</strong>: 'central' because it is centered on the median, which itself is the centre point of the data set, and '50%' because it contains 50% of the values in the data set.</p>
<p>The length of the interval, q3 minus q1, is called the <strong>interquartile distance</strong> (sometimes, the interquartile range).</p>
<p>If at least half the values are very close to the median, the quartiles will be close together; if the data do not group closely around the median, the quartiles will be further apart.</p>
<p>The quartiles do not have any special claim to exclusive use for defining a central interval.</p>
<p>However, classical statistical theory is not based on percentiles, and other measures of dispersion have been developed whose theoretical properties are better known and more convenient.</p>
<p><strong>Squared deviation</strong>:</p>
<p>(∑id2i) / (n-1) or I(∑id2i) / (n-1)</p>
<p>If n is quite large, it will hardly make any difference to the result whether we divide by n or (n-1).</p>
<p>Standard deviation: <em>s</em> has many other useful properties and, as a result, the standard deviation is the most frequently quoted measure of variability.</p>
<p>The standard deviation is one of the <em>most important statistical measures</em>. It indicates the typical amount by which values in the data set differ from the mean, x̄, and no data summary is complete until all relevant standard deviations have been calculated.</p>
<p>The standardized X scores: Z=(X-x̄)/s</p>
