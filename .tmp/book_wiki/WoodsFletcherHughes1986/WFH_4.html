        <p>This is the classical problem of statistical inference: how to infer from the properties of a part the likely properties of the whole.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is worth emphasizing at the outset that because of the way in which samples are selected at the outset that because of the way in which samples are selected in many studies in linguistics and applied linguistics, it is often simply not possible to generalize beyond the samples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <strong>population</strong> is the largest class to which we can generalize the results of an investigation based on a subclass.</p>
<p>The <strong>population of interest</strong> (or <strong>target population</strong>) will vary different and magnitude depending on the aims and circumstances of each different study or investigation.</p>
<p>It is highly likely, however, that the target population will necessarily be more limited than this as a result of the circumstances of the investigation from which the sample values are derived.</p>
<p>Deliberate constrains or accidental ones will either constrain the populations of interest or make any generalisation difficult or even impossible.</p>
<p>A population, then, for statistical purposes, is a set of values.</p>
<p>More technically, we need to be sure that the values that constitute the sample somehow reflect the target statistical population.</p>
<p><strong>Random sampling</strong> can overcome problems of overt or covert bias.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 'random' does not mean that the event in a sample are haphazard or completely lacking in order, but rather element in the population a known probability of being selected in the sample.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If our sample is not constructed according to a random procedure <em>we cannot be confident</em> that our estimates from it are likely to be close to the population values in which we are interested, and any generalisation will be of a dubious nature.</p>
<p>The most common type of sampling frame is a list of all the subjects in the group to which generalisation is intended.</p>
<p>The theory which underlies all the usual statistical methods assumes that, if the results obtained from a sample are to be generalised to a wider population, a suitable sampling frame has been established and the sample chosen randomly from the frame.</p>
<p>Statistical theory requires that sampling should be done in a special way before generalisation can be made formally from a sample to a population.</p>
<p>If these results are interesting -- suggesting some new hypothesis or contradicting a previously accepted one, for example -- then is time enough to question how the sample was obtained and whether this is likely to have a bearing on the validity of the conclusions reached.</p>
<p>Judge the results as though they were based on random samples and then look at the possibility that they may be distorted by the way the sample was, in fact, obtained. However, this imposes on researchers the inescapable duty of describing carefully how their experimental material -- including subjects -- was actually obtained.</p>
<p>When the subjects themselves determine to which experimental group they belong, whether deliberately or accidentally, <strong>the sampling needs to be done rather more carefully</strong>.</p>
