        <p>If we repeated the process n times, we could use the proportion of males among these <em>n</em> people as an estimate of the proportion or expected relative <strong>frequency</strong> of males in the population.</p>
<p>Provided only a small proportion of the total (say less than 10%) of the total is sampled it will not make much difference whether the sampling is done with or without replacement.</p>
<p><strong>Statistically independent</strong> means that knowing the value of one gives no information about the other.</p>
<p>P (X and Y together) = P (X|Y) * P(Y) = P (Y|X) * P (X)</p>
<p>A <strong>random variable</strong> can be thought of as any variable whose value, which cannot be predicted with certainty, is ascertained as the outcome of an experiment, usually a sampling experiment, or game of some kind.</p>
<p>The <strong>probability distribution</strong> of such a random variable is simply the list of probabilities of the different values that the variable can take.</p>
<p>If the different possible values of the variable can be enumerated or listed, it is called a <strong>discrete random variable</strong>.</p>
<p>For any discrete, numerical random variable, the probability that a single random observation has one of the separate values in the range.</p>
<p><strong>Random sampling</strong> or <strong>simple random sampling</strong> is a selection process which will ensure that every sample of three subjects has the same probability of being chosen.</p>
<p>It is good practice not to enter the random number tables always at the same point but to use some simple rule of your own for determining the entry point, based on the date or the time, or any quantity of this kind which will not always have the same value on every occasion you use the table.</p>
<p>Simple random sampling is not the only acceptable way to obtain samples. Although it does lead to the simplest statistical theory and the most direct interpretation of the data, it may not be easy to see how to obtain a simple random sample.</p>
