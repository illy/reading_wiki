        <h2>Ch10 Conclusion</h2>
<p>Both posts highlight the importance of interpersonal interaction and reciprocity to the exchange afforded by this communicative mode. (p191)</p>
<p>The tweets exemplify the properties of searchable talk that I have suggested characterize the ways people use language to affiliate via microblogging. (p191)</p>
<p>The hashtag allows users to mark an ideatiaonal target for the post as a kind of in-line metadata in relation to the values that are co-articulated. It in turn affords potential for ambient communities of values to coalesce around particular hashtags. (p191)</p>
<p>Affiliation is about more than connecting, it is about negotiating meanings within genres of language use. (p192)</p>
<p>Corpus-based data can provide us with quantitative accounts of how the interaction occurs. (p192)</p>
<p>In turn, close discourse analysis allows theory-driven social-cultural interpretation of linguistic patterns, where the researcher probes further into the meanings made. (p192)</p>
<p>Developing social media corpora is an important part of this endeavour, providing quantitative data for corpus analysis and instance-based data for discourse analysis. (p192)</p>
<p>Wielding the potential social insights that are captured by social media metadata requires knowledge of how to work with relational data. (p192)</p>
<p>In addition, given the episodic nature of social media as a form of streaming data, managing the time dimension is very important. (p192)</p>
<p>Sampling is a challenging with streaming social media data, and the social processes involved in status updating will look different depending on the timescale (Lemke 2000) from which it is viewed. (pp 192-193)</p>
<p>Add to this the many kinds of metadata that are collected by most social media, and you have a situation where the linguist needs more than basic darabase skills to wield the technology needed to interpret the relationships captured in even a text-based corpus - let alone a multimodal corpus. (p193)</p>
<p>Factoring in the additional problem of temporally dependent data, such as microblogging streams, the issues, while fascinating, start to become intractable. It is, however, this seeming intractability that will keep discourse analysis and corpus linguistics working together, leveraging the power of paired quantitative and qualitative acumen. (p193)</p>
<p>Microblogging involves a general process of offering an evaluative bond to potential bond network. The bondability of the discourse is increased by its searchability. (p194)</p>
<p>Searchable talk allows us to do more than retrieve information. It allows us to find common travellers who share out values. (p194)</p>
