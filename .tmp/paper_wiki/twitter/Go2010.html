        <p>Consumers can use sentiment analysis to research products or services before making a purchase. Marketers can use this to research public opinion of their company and products, or to analyze customer satisfaction. Organizations can also use this to gather critical feedback about problems in newly released products.</p>
<p>In this paper we make use of the hashtag convention to create features for machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>Our hypothesis</strong> is that we can achieve higher sentiment analysis accuracy by taking advantage of the unique characteristics of tweet data.</p>
<p>We perform three tasks in this paper: we use hashtag-related features, we perform sarcasm detection, and we cluster tweet data.</p>
<p>With the large range of topics discussed on Twitter, it would be very difficult to manually collect enough data to train a sentiment classifier for tweets. Our solution was to use distant supervision, in which our training data consists of tweets with emoticons.</p>
<p>We achieved up to 84% accuracy on the test set in our previous work. To help visualize the utility of a Twitter-based sentiment analysis tool, we also have a web application with our classifiers.</p>
<p><strong>Our hypothesis</strong> is that we can extract useful features related to hashtags, which will improve classification accuracy.</p>
<p>We only utilize mid-sentence hash-tags in this section and discard the rest.</p>
<p><strong>The motivation</strong> for using mid-sentence hashtags is to build better features with respect to a query term.</p>
<p>One assumption we make is that if an emoticon appears in the same sentence as a mid-sentence hashtag, the polarity of that emoticon reflects the person's feeling about the hashtag's topic.</p>
<p>This is a form of distant supervision, in which we have devised a way to automatically collect annotated data.</p>
<p>1.The advantage of this approach is that collecting this data is easy and cheap.</p>
<p>2.The disadvantage is that there may be noise in the training data, if our pre-processing step does not filter out low quality mid-sentence hashtags.</p>
<p>3.The other disadvantage is that not all people use hashtags in this manner, so it is unclear if this approach will work for all domains.
Position of surrounding unigrams. We use a window size of 7 words.</p>
<p>By definition of a rhetorical device, the words uttered in the sentence have an opposite polarity of what the speaker intends. This makes it tricky to associate the proper polarity class to text containing sarcasm.</p>
<p>The advantage of using tweets explicitly marked with the #sarcasm tag are that subjectivity is taken care of, the user definitely intended to be sarcastic. Thus, the data is high precision and not very noisy.</p>
<p>If the test data contains an emoticon or a #sarcasm tag, it does not influence the classifier because these features are not part of its training data. This is a current limitation of our approach because it would be useful to take emoticons into account when classifying test data.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis is that clustering will create topic-dependent clusters, and having a classifier for each topic cluster is better than having one classifier for all topics.</p>
<p>We perform K-Means clustering on the 10000 tweets in the new vector space.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental problems with sarcasm is that it is not sarcasm unless in a context.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis about profanity not helping that much was that most of the Twitter user base comprises of adults and perhaps for them profanity has become a part of regular language use.</p>
<p><strong>Utilizing clustering hurt performance overall</strong>.</p>
<p>1.The main problem with clustering seems to be that the clusters are very poor.</p>
<p>2.Our initial hypothesis is incorrect because the clusters do not form around topics. Instead, the clusters form around single words that are heavily influenced by the initial seeds.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Based on the previous work (Go, Bhayani &amp; Huang, 2009), Go and Bhayani (2010) use distant supervision to explore tweets containing mid-sentence hashtags. Combining unigram and bigram features, they investigate the features of mid-sentence hashtags as they are a helpful indicator of the topic and density of the polarity accuracy, and they also analyse the relationship between emoticons and hashtags with a focus of window size of 7 words. Moreover, they look at the sarcasm devices in tweets, especially tweets with the hashtag #sacarsm. They try to cluster tweets into topic based on single seed words, but the performance is not satisfied.</p>
