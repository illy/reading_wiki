        <h2>The language of microblogging</h2>
<p>Microblogging is a form of length-delimited communication using a social networking service. (p27)</p>
<p>The brevity encouraged by the medium affords frequency and continuous updating, and consequently, jokes around about the egocentricity of telling the world the minutiae of personal experiences that constitute your everyday life. (p27)</p>
<p>Unlike other social networking services, microblogging service generally allow asymmetrical relationship, between accounts. (p27)</p>
<p>A micropost may have a wide range of social functions realised by different microgenres, though it is not yet clear whether the linguistic patterning seen is best described through the lens of genre. (p27)</p>
<p>It is yet to be understood whether or how the intersection of different textual timelines that constitute a user's stream of posts can be modelled in terms of genre theory. (p27)</p>
<h3>The phatic dimension of microblogging</h3>
<p>Malinowski introduced the notion of 'phatic communion' as a way of describing communication in the service of establishing or solidifying bonds of companionship rather than serving 'any purpose or communicating ideas' (p 2004, p. 205). (p28)</p>
<p>If conceived in this way, microblogging functions as what Makice (2009) describes, using a computer metaphor, 'linguistic ping'. (p29)</p>
<p>This kind of phatic function is complementary to the more ideational description of Web 2.0 as driven by user-generated content.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that this phatic networking seen with all its interpersonal potential was anticipated in the original design of Twitter (with its origins in a concept for status updating via SMS). (p29)</p>
<p>The social importance of information sharing influences the content of tweets, and, as we will see in this chapter, the marker identifying a hyperlink is the fifth most common lexical item in HERMES, showing the extent to which users share web links with each others. (p29)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is much accompanying evidence that interpersonal meanings are also critical, and in any case, the ways in which information is shared is always subject to tenor variables, such as power relation. (p29)</p>
<p>Thus, a tweet may have both an information-sharing and a bonding function. (p29)</p>
<p>As with social media research in general, work on microblogging is generally interdisciplinary or cross-disciplinary. (p30)</p>
<p>There has been a tendency in the research to taxonomize the function of microposts based on on user intention. (p30)</p>
<p>Complementary to this content-based perspective is a more functional orientation considering how microposts make meaning and requiring detailed linguistic analyses. (p30)</p>
<h3>Microblogging as conversation</h3>
