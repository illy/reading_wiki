        <p>Any individual (observed) value can then be seen as being made up of two elements: the true value (the mean of the population), and the distance, or <strong>deviation</strong>, of the observed value from the true value.</p>
<p>The second element, the <strong>error</strong>, indicates the position of each observed value relative to the true value or mean.</p>
<p>In particular, it appears to be a common intuition that in a 'very large' sample the sample mean should have a value 'very close' to the population mean, µ.</p>
<p>The larger the sample size, the smaller the error is likely to be.</p>
<p><strong>Probability</strong> distribution for a list or a formula which indicates the relative frequency of occurrence of the different values of a random variable.</p>
<p>It is already obvious that the use of the word 'error' is hard to sustain, and we will from now on usually adopt the more neutral term <strong>residual</strong> which indicates that ɛ is the value remaining when µ has been subtracted (µ+ɛ-µ=ɛ)</p>
<p>To obtain the standard deviation for sample means of samples of size n the standard deviation of single scores should be divided by the square root of n.</p>
<p><strong>Random variation</strong> is in general use for those variation in repeated measurements which we seem unable to control.</p>
<p>Even if the histogram of the single scores had been skewed, or U-shaped, or whatever, the histogram of the means would still be symmetrical and bell-shaped for large samples.</p>
<p>It can be demonstrated theoretically that, for large samples, the histogram of the sample mean will always have the same mathematical formula irrespective of the pattern of variation in the single measurements that are used to calculate the means.</p>
<p>If samples of size n are repeatedly drawn from any population, and the sample means (i.e. the means of each of the samples) are plotted in a histogram, we find following three things happen, provided that n, the sample size, is large:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The histogram is symmetrical;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mean of the set of sample means is very close to that of the original population;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the standard deviation of the set of sample means will be very close to the original population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size, n.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the sample size, n, is large enough, then the histogram of the means of the samples of size n can always be very closely described by a single mathematical formula, irrespective of the population from which the samples are drawn.</p>
<p>A normal distribution can have any mean or standard deviation.</p>
