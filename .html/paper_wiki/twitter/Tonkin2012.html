        <p>Initial reactions to the events saw many commentators laying blame upon social networks such as Twitter, suggesting that networks are being used to incite social unrest and that their absence would reduce the likelihood of ongoing unrest.</p>
<p>From its beginning, it has been the subject matter of occasional BBC news items; for example, the BBC now refer to Twitter regularly as a news source (see Figure 1).</p>
<p>It is possible to see a cyclic element in the relationship between Twitter and the national UK media.</p>
<p>On the one hand the traditional media are driven by various factors, including events, existing discourse and public opinion (as represented by Twitter among other sources). On the other, as the service becomes entrenched in journalistic practice, some perceive the flip side of the coin, that Twitter content is driven by traditional media and traditional journalism – thus the potential cyclic element.</p>
<p>Boyd et al. [2] suggest that retweeting is part of a complex conversational ecology – more visible Twitter participants “retweet others and look to be retweeted” – and is a means of participating in a “diffuse conversation.” The frequency of repetition of a message does not imply accuracy;</p>
<p>Under some circumstances, it seems, Twitter can operate as an echo chamber for rumor/gossip.</p>
<p>As we will see in this article, it can also serve as a stage for humor or drama, and it can help to amplify humanitarian impulses. There is a temptation to see retweets as a “dramatic performance” [3], a sort of digital grandstanding before one's friends and acquaintances; yet to adopt this description wholesale would be to trivialize a very real interaction.</p>
<p>It is useful to note the context in which the tweet is placed by the author.</p>
<p>Terms starting with a #, or hash symbol, known as #hashtags, are treated specially by Twitter, enabling streams of tweets containing the same #hashtag to be read in sequential order by any user.</p>
<p>This device is often used to create the effect of a topical chatroom dedicated to the subject of that #hashtag.</p>
<p>New performance #hashtags appear often, and it is common for them to play on issues currently popular in traditional media.</p>
<p>The practical limitation is the character count limit of Twitter, which penalizes excessive #hashtag use. It is not, however, uncommon for two #hashtags to be in use simultaneously for a period of time.</p>
<p>Hashtags provide an exception to this rule: as Twitter users watch a #hashtag stream, they will see tweets from anywhere in the network. However, these tags are by default filtered by Twitter to show only top tweets, so the user must actively request an unfiltered view of the #hashtag stream.</p>
<p>The extent to which discourse on general social media and on Twitter, in particular, is driven by individual initiative or emerging consensus versus broader dissemination through traditional media is an open question.</p>
<p>Their findings unsurprisingly confirm that event-oriented topics constitute a larger proportion of NYT than they do for Twitter. But they also found that event-oriented topics are more actively spread through retweeting, particularly when significant world news such as natural disasters was the topic. Zhao and Jiang concluded that Twitter users are more likely to spread world news than other types of information.</p>
<p>The term flash mob applies to a decentralized group activity that typically has a performance aspect; for example, spontaneous group outbursts of dancing; a crowd converging on a public space to stand in motionless silence for a predefined time before moving on as though nothing had happened; or light-saber battles in a shopping center.</p>
<p>Flash mobs usually depend on the same technical communication links that are said to facilitate more sinister applications, such as organized gate-crashing and, indeed, riots.</p>
<p>It is clear that the impact of these events on Twitter users provides only a partial accounting of them.</p>
<p>The hashtag #OperationCupOfTea, which called for participants to “stay in and drink tea” (that is, establish a self-imposed curfew). An alternative interpretation related to another symbolic image: a police officer using an upturned riot shield as a tea tray.</p>
<p>Message content may be subjective or objective, informational or opinionated; Barbosa &amp; Feng [13] find that the most prolific tweeters frequently are advertising a product or service.</p>
<p>Following the harvesting process, we began by taking the following steps:</p>
<p>1.Identifying retweets and duplicate tweets</p>
<p>2.Identifying references to other participants in the social network, enabling a graph of participation to be built</p>
<p>3.Identifying repeated phrases, loosely describable as noun phrases plus relevant, usually adjectival, modifiers (police car, burning police car, vigilant people, long night,…).</p>
<p>4.Identifying individuals and locations (David Cameron, Clapham, …)</p>
<p>5.Identifying URLs and preprocessing them in order to identify their target URLs (if the link goes through a URL redirection service).</p>
<p>A contemporary gazetteer (a location database designed to support the extraction and resolving of place names from texts) may be used for this purpose. However, the success of this tool is at best partial, since there are many examples of contextually bound information, such as “on the street outside” or “near my office,” terms that require more contextual information to resolve successfully.</p>
<p>Six hundred thousand tweets were stored and analyzed as described above for topic, content and reference.</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that, twinned with a supervised learning algorithm such as a Bayes filter (a system trained on an existing reference data set) in order to classify types of entity, it is plausible to identify individuals (David Cameron, Boris Johnson), named events (England v Holland match), times/dates (tomorrow night), organizations (Sky News) and collective identifiers (London rioters, police officers).</p>
<p>It is also possible to identify theme-relevant compound terms such as rubber bullets and water cannon (proposed for use, but not employed during the disturbances) as well as social media and Facebook page, terms that appear extensively as a result of discussion in the traditional and new media about the role of social media in organizing and propagating the riots.</p>
<p>Retweeting is commonplace; slightly under half (over 48%) of the tweets identified contained a retweet over a quarter of non-retweets (original tweets) contained one or more links.</p>
<p>Of retweets, 45% in our dataset contain one or more links (an actionable URL).</p>
<p>The evidence shows us clearly that many of the individuals tweeting on the riots draw inspiration from news articles or directly make reference to news articles.</p>
<p>The most common phrases visible in the dataset appear to be driven by traditional media.</p>
<p>While the danger zones for riots in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Bristol are represented in the data, they appear with a relatively low frequency compared to themes arising from media coverage on topics related to the riots.</p>
<p>From the evidence collected, it appears that most people were either tweeting or retweeting news related to the riots. By contrast, original information or opinion appeared in a minority of tweets.</p>
<p>Analysis of the most popular links suggests that a large proportion of the most frequently mentioned links are themselves products of social media – images published online through yfrog, for example.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the single most popular sites referenced are images rather than textual resources</p>
<p>Each of these very popular images is separately identified by a large number of web links – several different URL shortcuts have been used by different twitter users.</p>
<p>However, Twitter seems to be less effective for crowd-sourcing than might be expected, due to the huge RT (retweet) echo effect from those who are not directly involved, most of whom appear to be reacting to media coverage rather than directly reporting individual experience.</p>
<p>As is the case in sentiment analysis in general, sarcasm and metaphor are stumbling blocks.</p>
<p>Human judgment, if supplemented with relevant contextual information and background knowledge about the community, is still not always able to tell for certain whether a tweet is satirical or intentionally inflammatory in intent; context is the key.</p>
<p>The emergence of a dominant #hashtag (as seen in Figure 2) for a channel is not a simple matter of nomination and acceptance.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is a collaborative process, sometimes it is competitive and often the process seems to involve elements of both.</p>
<p>15] call “semiotic dynamics,” meaning the process of developing and sharing a name for something, with the practical aim of using it to talk about the object in question.</p>
<p>Our methodology was based on the assumption that popular resources would be referenced under various names, and Figure 4 shows that such variety is indeed the case.</p>
<p>This practice has several effects, one being that it is difficult without individually checking out the destination of every</p>
<p>link to find out precisely how many people are talking about the same thing – indeed it is quite possible for many people to talk about the same web page without knowing it!</p>
<p>Another is the extreme dependency on URL shorteners. Their use may make it difficult for people to understand the context of archived conversations, since, if these shortened links no longer work, people will no longer be able to see the resources being discussed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discontinuance is a problem not only because of the possibility that the resource itself has
been taken offline, but also because the URL shortener may have been discontinued as a service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Retweets of an individual tweet do not necessarily identify the originator of the idea; instead, they usually identify the individual who formulated the tweet in its eventual, popular form.</p>
<p>These examples were chosen because there is no obvious mechanism to analyze the sentiment behind the decision to retweet; that is, there is no contextual information available on which to base a judgment.</p>
<p>The result suggests that there is a visible variation in the ratio between the number of followers and the number of retweets received; graphing this information shows a fairly coherent group of non-celebrity Twitter users, which appear in a different region of the graph from the broader range of celebrity users.</p>
<p>The usefulness of this observation depends on how well it generalizes to a broader dataset, which we will investigate as part of our future work.</p>
<p>Viewing the #hashtags over time, these tags can be placed into a hierarchy of parent/child relationships depicting how the information of the tweets' #hashtags are being passed along.</p>
<p>This hierarchy is referred to as a conceptual ontology [17], where the concepts in the hierarchy are actually the #hashtags themselves.</p>
<p>From the data that we were able to retrieve from Twitter on the London riots, three aspects of tweeting became clear: 1) people support and retweet conversations that support their beliefs; 2) tweets that are off topic and have unrelated information die on their own; and 3) tweets that are made by popular or newsworthy people are more supported (retweeted), in general, than non-notable people.</p>
<p>There's little data to support the idea that the service was widely used for inappropriate uses – tweets of this nature generally either die out without being retweeted or are retweeted to “name and shame” the offender.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Tonkin, Pfeiffer &amp; Tourte (2012) perform an empirical study on six hundred thousand tweets related to London riot, and conclude that Twitter only play a limited role in the London riot. They suggest that there was an intuition that the Twitter might be a stimulus to the London riot, but Twitter often plays as a role of "an echo chamber for rumour/gossip", for example, retweet would reduce the information diffusion effectiveness as a result of uninvolved participants' interests. In Britain, there seems to be a cyclic element between Twitter and traditional media, such as BBC. For examples, BBC has cited information from Twitter more often than before, and they have more and more interactions with their audience on Twitter with the use of the hashtag. The result indicates that many people who tweeted about the riot were inspired by the traditional media news, so "original information or opinion appeared in a minority of tweets". Also, image-related tweets are often more popular than pure textual tweets. They found that a supervised method such as Bayes filter is able to identify the temporal, spacial information in tweets, as well as name entity and topical information. In addition, they point out that lacking of context result that the sarcasm and metaphor are still the obstacles in sentiment analysis, and that it is not easy to understand the motivation of retweeting. Furthermore, they suggest that URL shortener has become an important host of information because it may cause discontinuance of the information. They also reveal that there is a hierarchical relationship between different hashtags, and they demonstrate this as a conceptual ontology.</p>
