        <p>A simple model that is commonly used to interpret movements in corporate common stock. price indexes asserts that real stock prices equal the present value of rationally expected or optimally forecasted future real dividends discounted by a constant real discount rate.</p>
<p>It has often been claimed in popular discussions that stock price indexes seem too "volatile," that is, that the movements in stock price indexes could not realistically be attributed to any objective new information, since movements in the price indexes seem to be "too big" relative to actual subsequent events</p>
<p>This paper takes as its starting point the approach I used earlier (1979) which showed evidence suggesting that long-term bond yields are too volatile to accord with simple expectations models of the term structure of interest rates.4</p>
<p>This paper also has benefited from the earlier discussion by LeRoy and Porter which independently derived some restrictions on security price volatility implied by the efficient markets model and concluded that common stock prices are too volatile to accord with the model.</p>
<p>Of course, if real stock prices are "too volatile" as it is defined here, then there may well be a sort of real profit opportunity.</p>
<p>This paper is concerned, however, instead with a more interesting (from an economic standpoint) question: what accounts for movements in real stock prices and can they be explained by new information about subsequent real dividends.</p>
<p>As we move back from the terminal date, the importance of the terminal value chosen declines</p>
<p>It has been repeatedly noted that stock price change distributions show high kurtosis or "fat tails." This means that, if one looks at a time-series of observations on Sp or Ap, one sees long stretches of time when their (absolute) values are all rather small and then an occasional extremely large (absolute) value</p>
<p>This phenomenon is commonly attributed to a tendency for new information to come in big lumps infrequently.</p>
<p>There seems to be a common presumption that this information lumping might cause stock price changes to have high or infinite variance, which would seem to contradict the conclusion in the preceding section that the variance of price is limited and is maximized if forecasts have a simple autoregressive structure</p>
<p>High sample kurtosis does not indicate infinite variance if we do not assume, as did Fama (1965) and others, that price changes are drawn from the stable Paretian class of distribution</p>
<p>The model does not suggest that price changes have a distribution in this class. The model instead suggests that the existence of moments for the price series is implied by the existence of moments for the dividends series.</p>
<p>Hence, by choosing n high enough one can achieve an arbitrarily high kurtosis, and yet the variance of price will always exist.</p>
<p>Moreover, the distribution of A conditional on the information that the dividend has been revealed is also normal, in spite of high kurtosis of the unconditional distribution.</p>
<p>In the above example, where information about dividends is revealed one time in n, a(3p) = n 1/2a(d) and a(Ap) = Y(2/n)1/2a(d). The values of a(3p) and a( \p) implied by this example are for all n strictly below the upper bounds of the inequalities (1 1) and (13).13</p>
<p>There is no reason why price per share ought to be the present value of expected earnings per share if some earnings are retained.</p>
<p>The violation of the inequalities implies that "innovations" in price as we measure them can be forecasted</p>
<p>These regression tests, while technically valid, may not be as generally useful for appraising the validity of the model as are the simple volatility comparisons</p>
<p>We have seen that measures of stock price volatility over the past century appear to be far too high - five to thirteen times too high - to be attributed to new information about future real dividends if uncertainty about future dividends is measured by the sample standard deviations of real dividends around their long-run exponential growth path.</p>
<p>The failure of the efficient markets model is thus so dramatic that it would seem impossible to attribute the failure to such things as data errors, price index problems, or changes in tax laws.</p>
<p>One way of saving the general notion of efficient markets would be to attribute the movements in stock prices to changes in expected real interest rates</p>
<p>I have shown, however, that the movements in expected real interest rates that would justify the variability in stock prices are very large- much larger than the movements in nominal interest rates over the sample period</p>
<p>Another way of saving the general notion of efficient markets is to say that our measure of the uncertainty regarding future dividends - the sample standard deviation of the movements of real dividends around their long - run exponential growth path - understates the true uncertainty about future dividends.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Shiller (1981) argues that there is a too high estimation of volatilisation in the stock market prediction, which would restrict the efficient market theory. Thus, he uses a different model to evaluate the volatilisation and use some empirical data to verify. The solutions he provides are "attribute the movements in stock prices to changes in expected real interest rates', and "to say that our measure of the uncertainty regarding future dividends… understates the true uncertainty about future dividends"."</p>
