        <p>We decided, in order to develop a better understanding of the mechanism involved in these informal channels of communication, to initiate a research study of our own.</p>
<p>The <strong>most significant</strong> of these included:</p>
<p>1.What are the reasons for the growing importance of Word-of-Mouth recommendation? in what psychological needs is it rooted?</p>
<p>2.What motivates people to talk about their experiences?</p>
<p>3.What motivates them to listen to recommendations? To act or not to act them?</p>
<p>4.How does Word-of-Mouth recommendation affect advertising, and how does advertising affect Word-of-Mouth?</p>
<p>5.How does this whole process influence the purchasing behavior of th contemporary American consumer?</p>
<p>When the consumer believes that an advertisement is more of a sales tool than information and guidance, he feels threatened. He rejects the advertising claim.</p>
<p>When the consumer feels that the advertiser speaks to him as a friend or as an unbiased authority, creating the atmosphere of Word-of-Mouth, the consumer will relax and tend to accept the recommendation.</p>
<p>There are <em>two</em> kinds of Word-of-Mouth: predecision and post-decision.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The do not have the same object, and they probably do not take place in the same way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>most effective</strong> Word-of-Mouth for the advertiser is the post-decision speaker who is bent to eliminating all dissonance in his post-decision situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He is the man to sell to because he will be an active propagandist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this same reason, advertising should perhaps be oriented much more toward present than potential customers and use them to spread the good word.</p>
<p>It is the sense of out findings that the <em>most effective advertising i s that which follows the same psychological channels of communication and satisfies the same motivation on which the whole importance and success of Word-of-Mouth rest.</em></p>
<p>Two specific problems of the psychology of Word-of-Mouth recommendation:</p>
<p>1.What motivates a person to talk about a product or service?</p>
<p>2.What motivates a person to listen to a recommendation and to act on it?
The power and significance of everyday Word-of-Mouth lie mainly in the speaker's lack of material interest.</p>
<p>Our investigation confirms that -generally - nobody will speak about products or services unless the talking itself, promises satisfactoriness of some kind - popularly speaking, unless he 'gets something out of it.'</p>
<p>We found further that the speaker is likely to choose such products, such listeners, and such 'words' as are most apt to serve his underlying needs and ends (of which he is only rarely or partially aware).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Motivations to talk about products or services were found to fall into four main categories, frequently overlapping or combined:</p>
<p>1.product-involvement (33%)</p>
<p>2.self-involvement (24%)</p>
<p>(Usually the follower is reassured by the power and strength of his leader. However, in Word-of-Mouth we often found the reverse to be true: followers are sought by the leader(speaker) so that he feels less lonely and more secure in his own product choice.) Knowing that others will confirm to his choice makes him feel good.</p>
<p>The degree to which the need for self-confirmation motivates Word-of-Mouth recommendation is reflected in the speaker's reaction to a rejection of his advice.</p>
<p>The 'bandwagon' effect is reversed in cases in which consumers are proud to use what they consider an 'underdog' product. They feel gratified in defying the majority by publicly using an unpopular brand; but the real self-confirmation lies in converging others to their 'own' choice.</p>
<p>Frequently, the hurt and resentment about nonacceptance turn into hostility against the unwilling followers. In a rapid process of depreciation, the erstwhile friend or neighbor, or relative, is now accused of 'double-crossing' the speaker.</p>
<p>Generally, the self-involved speaker feels that the listener has a moral duty not only to try the recommended product, but also to share his - the speaker's - feelings about it, to report back to him, to be grateful, and thus to confirm the speaker's judgment.</p>
<p>3.other-involvement (20%)</p>
<p>Products serve mainly as instruments which help to express sentiment of neighborliness, care, friendship, and love.</p>
<p>4.message-involvement</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Listener's motivation:</p>
<p>The answer is that to make a recommendation 'carry', the three points of the triangle - speaker, listener, and product - have to 'fit' each other in certain ways. (to some degree the quality of the message also is involved)</p>
<p>However, we have accepted the fact that need is not necessarily a 'given' entity; it can within certain limits be produced or stimulated.</p>
<p>The listener is primarily concerned about two key conditions:</p>
<p>1.that the person who recommends is interested in him and his well-being,</p>
<p>2.that the speaker's experience with and knowledge about the product are convincing.</p>
<p>Our research at the institute has shown that only a dialogue - that is, two-way communication - is truly effective.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This applies to formal communication in mass media, but even more to the informal influence of Word-of-Mouth interaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Speakers" expect and/or receive certain gratifications; they will not recommend things 'for nothing'/ However, in typical Word-of-Mouth incidents, these rewards are always purely psychological, and never material.</p>
<p>This very assumption - that no material interest is involved in the recommendation - is the most basic motivation for the 'listener' in accepting and acting on the recommendation.</p>
<p>Two main problems in application:</p>
<p>1.How to simulate Word-of-Mouth?</p>
<p>2.How to stimulate Word-of-Mouth?</p>
<p>There are two approaches which can lead the advertise closer to the positions of the reader's friend and fellow consumer:</p>
<p>1.proving his 'intention'</p>
<p>2.improving his authentic relationship to the product.</p>
<p>In case in which the advertiser's own voice is not convincing enough, he may call in a third person as intermediary between him and the listener (testimonial).</p>
<p>It emphasize the new role of the advertiser as that of a friend who recommends a trial and trusted product, as against that of a salesman who tries to get rid of merchandises.</p>
<p>Advertising cannot sell against personal influence.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Dichter (1966) discusses how word-of-mouth advertising works. ACcording to him, the motivation of talking about service or products falling into four main categories: product-involvement, self-involvement, other-involvement, and message-involvement. The author argues a close link between successful, everyday word-of-mouth recommendations and effective advertising. This emphasizes the new role of friends and acquaintances as "advertisers" who recommends a tried and trusted product. This advice is often more trusted than the sales pitch of a seller who is trying to sell merchandise.</p>
