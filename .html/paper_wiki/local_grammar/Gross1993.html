        <p>In the study of collocations and of <strong>frozen sentences</strong> (idioms, clich√©s, collocations, many metaphors and figurative meanings, etc.) one often encounters sets of similar forms that cannot be related by formal rules of either type: phrase structure or transformational.</p>
<p><strong>Transformational grammars</strong> are global grammars whose aim is to describe the sentences of a language at a formal level, that is, in strictly combinatorial terms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The descriptions are intended to be complete, namely to attain a coverage as extended as possible of the language. Moreover, the grammar of a language should be such that non sentences should fall outside of its range in an explicit way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To achieve this goal, Z.S. Harris and N. Chomsky have proposed combinatorial systems specialized in the following way:</p>
<p>1.elementary sentences are described by formation rules,</p>
<p>2.complex sentences combine sentences (starting from elementary ones) into more complex forms.</p>
<p>Accordingly, transformational rules are of two types:</p>
<p>1.unary, transforming an elementary basic sentence into another elementary form,</p>
<p>2.binary, transforming a pair of sentences into a more complex one.</p>
<p>In Z.S. Harris' transformational framework, transformations are equivalence relations that operate between two sentences and thus define equivalence classes.</p>
<p>The decision to introduce a given transformation is based on empirical observations subjected to a precisely defined methodology: intuitions about relatedness of sentences, especially intuitions of synonymy of sentences are numerous, but in order to be formalized into a transformation, such intuitions must be either confirmed by formal arguments that justify a transformational link between them or else left with the intuitive status of synonymous sentences or paraphrases, not representable by grammatical methods.</p>
<p>they are clearly synonymous and the two locative noun phrases by which they differ do not contribute to their meaning.</p>
<p>Such a graph is read from left to right, that is, from the initial state to the final state.</p>
<p>Each path represents a sentence. Such finite state graphs or automata are restricted here to finite paths (i.e. no loops are allowed), they are called Directed Acyclic Graphs or DAGs.</p>
<p>We discuss elementary sentences, that is, sentences of the shape subject-verb- essential complements (if any). We write N0 V W for such general shapes. Since each verb governs a specific string of complements, we will specify structures in the following way.</p>
<p>N0 V W =: N0</p>
<p>give N1 to N2 The symbols Ni (i = 0, 1, ...) stand for noun phrases.</p>
<p>The question of the attachment of a preposition (here to) to its noun phrase is open.</p>
<p>In order to indicate this change of function, we can write: N0 give (N2)1 (N1)2</p>
<p>Hence, the following form is accepted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The incident took place on May 2nd</p>
</blockquote>
<p>implying that the year is either the year when the sentence was uttered or a year already mentioned in the context</p>
<p>Hence omitting NumYear is exactly like omitting a pronoun, a coreference effect is created and all the problems of attaching the truncated date to a full date are the general problems of the location of an antecedent for a pronoun.</p>
<p>So far we have dealt with a family of strings formally defined by two operations on a given sequence of words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>allowing substitutions of words,</p>
<p>allowing omission of words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can we save such duplications by introducing permutation rules, that is transformational rules? The answer is clearly no in the case of the date adverbials starting with in, since no numeral of day is allowed.</p>
<p>On the whole, from the point of view of savings that we have developed, a notion of non redundant grammar can be outlined as a system of two components:</p>
<p>1.formation rules constituted by finite-state graphs generating elementary sentences and phrases,</p>
<p>2.transformation rules that modify the initial graphs, introducing variants, mainly variants of word order.</p>
<p>in a shaded box the name of an automaton is indicated which is to be inserted in the automaton of the sentences and which is of the same nature as this main automaton.</p>
<p>To sum up these observations and proposals, we have to modify the classical component of formation rules in the following way:</p>
<p>1.finite state grammars are used to generate sentences as strings of words,</p>
<p>2.a constituent analysis must be superimposed on these strings.</p>
<p>Then the transformational component must be generalized so as to operate on finite-state graphs with marked constituent structure:</p>
