The kind of discourse-search that Twitter affords has been described as a rival to Google, with commentators claiming that searching Twitter may soon be one of the most effective ways to gather useful information, since returns capture what users are saying online in real-time (Rocketboom, 2009).

This cultural shift to interpersonal search has resulted in the emergence of searchable talk, that is, online discourse where the primary function appears to be affiliation via ‘findability’. This kind of talk expands linguistic meaning potential by using punctuation to incorporate metadata into language so that online talk can be found.

Taking a corpus of posts to Twitter as a case study, this article aims to suggest how search is beginning to function as a community-building linguistic activity. It will demonstrate how what are known as ‘hashtags’ function as linguistic markers enacting the following social relation: ‘Search for me and affiliate with my value!’.

While studies of online discourse from a linguistic perspective are relatively established (Baron, 2008; Crystal, 2006; Herring, 1996), whether analysis of linguistic function and structure can serve as evidence for defining communities is an emergent area of inquiry.

This article begins by introducing Twitter and a corpus of tweets (messages posted to Twitter) containing the keyword ‘Obama’ collected in the 24 hours after the announcement that Barak Obama had won the 2008 US presidential election.

The aim of the appraisal analysis undertaken in this article is to show the kinds of interpersonal meanings made in the corpus of tweets and their role in ambient affiliation.

Hence we see creative use of punctuation to reference other users and tag common topics. These expansions in typographic meaning potential are part of a community-driven movement toward Twitter becoming a form of ‘public conversation’. It is conversation, however, that is multiparty, temporarily fluid and highly intertextual.

This character usage derives from Internet Relay Chat (IRC) conventions for naming channels.

Within a tweet, a tag marked by a # sets up an attributive relationship between the tweet as a tagged token and the tag as its type. Halliday and Matthiessen (2004: 219) define attributive relational processes as relationships where ‘an entity has some class ascribed or attributed to it’.

n other words, hashtags inscribe a keyword in a tweet as metadata referencing the topic of the message as assigned by the user.

The ‘tag as type’ relationship assumes that other users will also adopt this tag and use it as a keyword for a tweet on this topic. By generating keywords describing their discourse in this way, Twitter users enter into the social realm of collaborative tagging, or ‘folksonomy’ (Vander Wal, 2007).

Collaborative tagging is a social form of verbal indexing involving a ‘bottom-up’ approach to the kind of classification previously achieved by reference librarians.

Tweets and the hashtags which they contain may thus be thought of a two different orders of experience: a tweet is an instance of language use, while a tag is language about language, performing what this article will show is an affiliative function.

The aim was not to construct a representative corpus of the linguistic activity on Twitter, but instead to conduct a case study in which field variables, that is, the topic of the tweets, was held relatively constant to afford a rich investigation of meaning-making in a single domain on Twitter.

In this way, a tweet is a text with multiple expression plane realizations or, in other words, with no single stable visual or typographic form. Thus tweets are likely to be particularly capricious objects for multimodal discourse analysis which considers how meanings are made with both language and paralanguage.

A key functional unit in SFL is the clause. A clause corresponds to the notion of a simple sentence.

Knight (2008) suggests that couplings of interpersonal and ideational meanings have an affiliative function.

This is a perspective that considers language paradigmatically in terms of ‘what could go instead of what’ (Halliday and Matthiessen, 2004: 22) rather than modelling language as a catalogue of structures.

Since it was beyond the scope of manual analysis to analyse the entire corpus of tweets using the close text analysis involved in appraisal analysis, a random sample of 100 tweets was annotated for appraisal.

Twitter, as some commentators have noted, may be performing a more interpersonal function: ‘The best Tweets tend to make an observation, take a stance, or crack a joke–none of which fall under the umbrella of using Twitter to tell the world what you’re doing’ (McCracken, 2009).

The kind of evaluative language that sampled above suggests that the tweets may be forming a more interpersonal social function in which users are affiliating around values relating to the election result.

The inline nature of #tag usage opens up the possibility of play with users creating tags that are unlikely to be used as search terms and which instead seem to function to intensify the evaluation made in the tweet.

Markup is typically hidden by browsers and other display devices; however, hashtags on Twitter are visible within clauses in tweets and no technology is used to obscure them.

The affiliation is ambient in the sense that the users may not have interacted directly and likely do not know each other, and may not interact again.

Interpersonally-charged tweets invite with their hashtags an ambient audience to align with their bonds.

StreamGraphs are an example of a text visualization technique that does not efface logogenesis, the unfolding of text over time (Zappavigna, forthcoming).

While an area graph usually shows a single data series, StreamGraphs are a form of stacked area graph that represent multiple data series by stacking one on top of the other. In a stacked area graph the height of the curve at a given point represents the total frequency of all features at that point and thus each data series should be read as starting at zero rather than as their accumulative height.

This makes the graphing technique most useful to a linguist interested in the general trend of a data series, or in other words, the qualitative ebb and flow of the annotated units over the time series. It is also a useful technique for appreciating the relationships between the data series as they unfold by the overall impression of the relative amount of colour.

Criticism of Twitter as a service facilitating inane and frequent status updates about users’ activities seems to have missed the social point of twittering.

Twitter offers a medium for expressing personal evaluation to a large body of listeners with which one can affiliate ambiently.

This article has argued that by presenting couplings of evaluative and ideational meanings, a tweet invites the follower or searcher to share in the values presented.

The approach taken in this article has been informed by two complementary traditions in linguistics: Systemic Functional Linguistics and Corpus Linguistics, both of which offer useful, replicable strategies for analysing how language works in its social contexts.
