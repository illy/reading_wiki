 A key distinguishing factor of these smaller networks is that they provide a new means of communication.

 A distinguishing factor of such smaller networks and applica- tions is their ability to deliver the data to interested users over mul- tiple delivery channels.

 Our goal is to characterize a novel communication network in depth, its user base and geographical spread, and compare results of different crawling techniques in the presence of constraints from a generic measurement point of view.

 The bulk of the users exhibit roughly symmetric behavior.

 Nearly 60% come from â€œWeb" which includes the twitter.com Web site and unregistered applica- tions that use the API.
 
 Mobile devices and Instant Messages have visible presence. A fifth of all status updates come from the var- ious custom applications that have been written using the Twit- ter API.
 
 Twitter traffic increased significantly when the API was opened up [17].
 
 Figure 4 shows that many of the users in the first group do tweet a lot, confirming that they are broadcasters.
 
 There is no significant difference between the crawl and timeline datasets.
 
 There was no significant information in the patterns within days of the week (not shown).
 
 Also not shown, there is virtually no difference between the length of tweets in the crawl and timeline datasets.
 
 After USA, the top-10 countries are Japan, Germany, U.K., Brazil, Holland, France, Spain, Belgium, Canada, and Italy. These eleven countries account for around 50% of users in our datasets.
 
 A higher friends and followers count can be seen in the .jp domain, perhaps reflective of the more connected nature and popularity of such technologies in Japan.
 
 We examined if highly popular users (those who have many fol- lowers) update their status more often than those who (likely pas- sively) follow more users. This was true in both the crawl and time- line (not shown) datasets."
