One of the most potent ideas in the social sciences is the notion that individuals are embedded in thick webs of social relations and interactions.

Moreno argued, provided channels for the flow of social influence and ideas among the girls. In a way that even the girls them-selves may not have been conscious of, it was their location in the social network that determined whether and when they ran away.

Moreno envisioned sociometry as a kind of physics, complete with its own “social atoms” and its laws of “social gravitation” (3).

###1940s-1950s

One front was the use of matrix algebra and graph theory to formalize fundamental social-psychological concepts such as groups and social circles in network terms, making it possible to objectively discover emergent groups in network data (5).

Another front was the development of a program of lab-oratory experimentation on networks.

The more centralized structures, such as the star structure, outperformed decentralized structures, such as the circle, even though it could be shown mathematically that the circle structure had, in principle, the shortest minimum solution time (6).

Why the discrepancy? Achieving the mathematically optimal solution would have required the nodes to execute a fairly complex sequence of information trades in which no single node served as integrator of the information. But the tendency in human networks seemed to be for the more peripheral members of a network (i.e., the nodes colored blue in the “Star,” “Y ,” and “Chain” net-works in Fig. 2) to channel infor-mation to the most central node (i.e., the nodes colored red in Fig. 2), who then decided what the correct answer was and sent this answer back out to the other nodes.

During this period, network analysis was also used by sociologists interested in studying the changing social fabric of cities.

The common conviction at the time was that urbanization destroyed community, and that cities played a central role in this drama.

The basic procedure for eliciting network data was to get re-spondents (egos) to identify people (alters) with whom they had various kinds of relationships and then to also ask ego about the relationships between some or all of the alters.

The representation and analysis of community network structure remains at the forefront of net-work research in the social sciences today, with growing interest in unraveling the structure of computer-supported virtual communities that have proliferated in recent years (12).

###1960s

By the 1960s, the network per-spective was thriving in anthropol-ogy. Influenced by the pioneering work of Radcliffe Brown (13), there were three main lines of inquiry.

 >The more connected the network, the more likely the couple would maintain a tradi-tional segregation of husband and wife roles, showing that the structure of the larger network can affect relations and behaviors within the dyad.

In the 1970s, the center of gravity of network research shifted to sociology.

 >It was also noted that structurally equivalent individuals faced similar social environments and therefore

could be expected to develop similar responses, such as similar attitudes or behaviors (20).

Another key contribution was the influential strength of weak ties (SWT) theory developed by Granovetter (21).

By the 1980s, social network analysis had become an established field within the social sciences, with a professional organization (INSNA, International Network for Social Network Analysis), an annual conference (Sunbelt), specialized soft-ware (e.g., UCINET), and its own journal (Social Networks).

In the 1990s, network analysis radiated into a great number of fields, including physics and biology. It also made its way into several applied fields such as management consulting (23), public health (24), and crime/war fighting (25).

Crime-fighters, particularly those fighting organized crime, have used a network perspective for many years, covering walls with huge maps showing links between “persons of interest.” **This network approach is often credited with contributing to the capture of Saddam Hussein**.

Perhaps the oldest criticism of social network research is that the field **lacks a (native) theoretical understanding** —it is “merely descriptive” or “just methodology.”

the typology shown in Fig. 3 divides dyadic relations into four basic types—similarities, social relations, interactions, and flows. Much of social network research can be seen as working out how these different kinds of ties affect each other.

A **key task** of social network analysis has been to invent graph-theoretic properties that characterize structures, positions, and dyadic properties (such as the cohesion or connectedness of the structure) and the overall “shape” (i.e., distribution) of ties.

At the node level of analysis, the most widely studied concept is centrality—a family of node-level properties relating to the structural importance or prominence of a node in the network.

In the physical sciences, a key research goal has been formulating universal characteristics of nonrandom networks, such as the property of having a scale-free degree distribution. In the social sciences, however, researchers have tended to emphasize variation in structure across different groups or contexts, using these variations to explain differences in outcomes.

A research goal that the social and physical sciences have shared has been to explain the formation of network ties and, more generally, to predict a host of network properties, such as the clusteredness of networks or the distributions of node centrality.

Although there are many studies of network antecedents, the primary focus of network research in the social sciences has been on the consequences of networks. Perhaps the most fundamental axiom in social network research is that a node's position in a network determines in part the opportunities and constraints that it encounters, and in this way plays an important role in a node's outcomes.

Perhaps **the most common mechanism** for explaining consequences of social network variables is some form of direct transmission from node to node.

The idea is that social ties can bind nodes together in such a way as to construct a new entity whose properties can be different from those of its constituent elements.

Binding is one of the mechanisms behind the popular notion of the performance benefits of“structur-al holes” (Fig. 4). Given an ego-network (the set of nodes with direct ties to a focal node, called “ego,” together with the set of ties among members of the ego network), a structural hole is the absence of a tie among a pair of nodes in the ego network (22).

A well-established proposition in social network analysis is that egos with lots of structural holes are better per-formers in certain competitive settings (19).

The lack of structural holes around a node means that the node's contacts are “bound” together—they can communicate and coordinate so as to act as one, creating a formidable “other” to negotiate with. This is the basic principle behind the ben-efits of worker's unions and political alliances.

a node with many structural holes can play unconnected nodes against each other, divid-ing and conquering.

However, nodes b and d are stronger because each have partners (nodes a and e) that are in weak positions (no alternative bargaining partners).

**Having only strong nodes to bargain with makes node c weak.**

Social scientists have also been more concerned than the physical scientists with the individual node, whether an individual or a collective such as a company, than with the network as a whole.

From a social scientist's point of view, network research in the physical sciences can seem alarmingly simplistic and coarse-grained.

And, no doubt, from a physical scientist's point of view, network re-search in the social sciences must appear oddly mired in the minute and the particular, using tiny data sets and treating every context as different.

###Summary

Borgatti et al. (2009) compare the differences between social network analysis and physical network analysis, trying to bridge the gap between social science and physical science. Different from physical network, social network is more flexible, and the relationship between each node is more complicated, thus the research perspective has accordingly changed: the types of ties, the importance of structure, the research question. As they notice, opposites to physical scientists, social scientists pay more attention to the individual in the network; also, social network research focus more on the variance and the consequence of the network.
