'Word-Of-Mouth’ (WOM) is a powerful and primitive tool for transmitting information between people.

It is well known, and not necessary to demonstrate, the great influence of information communicated by word of mouth, which we consider credible even when coming from people who are not part of our inner circle.

If traditional WOM has great power of influence, OWOM has even more due to the rapid and wide diffusion of a view has across the networks, especially if it has been published on a microblogging platform like Twitter.

The EWOM could have the same problem, so some authors have questioned the truthfulness of the information published in social media platforms like Twitter

In the literature related to the SA in long texts, a distinction is made between studies of texts where we assume that the text is an opinion and therefore solely need to calculate its polarity (polarity classification), and those in which before measuring polarity it is necessary to determine whether the text is subjective or objective (subjectivity classification).

Concerning the study of polarity in Twitter, most experiments assume that tweets are subjective.

Finally, the authors applied a machine learning process to classify the polarity of the tweets. In this process, the performance of three algorithms was assessed: SVM, Naïve Bayes and Conditional Random Fields (CRF). The authors concluded that the best configuration for the analysis of opinions on Twitter is to use the Naïve Bayes algorithm, and use n-grams and Post-tags as characteristics of the tweets.

Those based on lexical resources often have the problem of obtaining low recall values because they depend on the presence of the words comprising the lexicon in the message to determine the orientation of opinion.

Machine learning based methods meanwhile depend on the availability of labelled data sets.

The authors selected a set of subjective words from all those available in English and added hashtags with a subjective meaning.

Up to now all the studies described which follow a strategy based on machine learning have used traditional methods, which is to say algorithms normally used for ‘static’ text classification.

Aisopos et al. (2012) note some difficulties faced by SA on Twitter: the sparsity of the data, the use of non-standard vocabulary, the low grammar quality of the messages and multilingual nature of the texts published on Twitter.

The context model is in our view a bit simple, because the authors based their model on the behaviour of the users whose tweets are in the corpus used for the experiment, e.g. they claim that the users that usually post neutral tweets publish more than those that post positive or negative tweets.

One of the problems of SA in Twitter stressed in Aisopos et al. (2012) was the sparsity of the texts due to the large variety of short and irregular forms found in tweets because of the 140-character limit.

Saif, He and Alani (2012) assessed two methods for solving the sparsity problem. The first method consists of mapping some words to semantic concepts,

The other proposal is based on the joint sentiment/topic model (JST) (Lin and He 2009) that instead of mapping semantic concepts, clusters sentiment concepts.

This encouraged the authors to develop a method of linear regression for the prediction of the revenue, to which new elements were added such as seven variables corresponding to each tweet-rate for each day of the week, and seeing that this improved the results they added to the model the number of cinemas which would show the film for the first time, achieving a high correlation with the latter combination.

One very important challenge is related to information retrieval, in which there are two approaches: the first one aims at finding the answers to questions that Twitter users tend to post on their profiles, much like a question-answering portal; and the second approach is more related to information retrieval and presentation of the results of the user query.

Mentions are indicative of the possible initiation of a conversation between two or more users, a fact that can be used to perform user profiles and comparison of users, create graphs of relationships between users, or discover similar users.

This method has the risk of harvesting only the tweets which contain the keywords, and not those related tweets that could be more relevant.

Sarcasm has been studied extensively from a linguistic and psychological point of view (Gibbs 1986; Kreuz and Glucksberg 1989), but in the field of text mining and more specifically SA, fewer studies have been performed, mainly due to its complexity.

Direct mentions and positive and negative emoticons are the elements which appear most in sarcastic messages.

The SA in Twitter may have many applications, but these should be defined correctly.
