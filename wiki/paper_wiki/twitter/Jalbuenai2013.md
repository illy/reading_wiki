This research is a quantitative-qualitative type of research that used authentic quoted tweets of the twenty-five Twitter followings of the researcher.

This study explored the use of Twitter to understand the lexical, grammatical and rhetorical features of selected Twitter users in five different theme categories: academe (education), entertainment, personal, politics and social issues by selected Twitter users covering a period of two weeks, from December 01 to December 14, 2011.

Out of the total 1,754 tweets, politics category got the highest in frequency of tweets with 695. This reflected their massive use of reply feature on Twitter as they highly addressed and regarded other people in tweets.

Although the structure of CLAWS has seen some changes since the first version was produced, it still consists of three stages: pre-edit, automatic tag assignment, and manual post-edit.

To classify the tonality of tweets whether the researcher’s Twitter followings used formal or informal language, the researcher used the web classifier www.uclassify.com.

Function words include prepositions, pronouns, auxiliary verbs, conjunctions, articles and interjections.

Open class words (lexical words) generally include various kinds of nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives.

it was found out that the use of singular nouns are more prominent in the CLAWS POS Tagger tool extracted from the tweets of users from the five categories.

in the case of tweeting tweets for Twitter, the use of capitalization is not important at all.

Based on the results, entertainment category got the highest number of adjectives used in their tweet conversations.

It is very noticeable in the politics category wherein most of the users used a large data of the lexical verbs.

The most number of occurrences of adverbs were taken from the unmarked adverb with 496 followed by whadverbs (453) which answers the questions such as “how,” “when,” “where,” “how much” based on the CLAWS POS Tagger extraction result.

The verb is perhaps the most important part Table 1 of a sentence just as in the Twitter conversation.

Lexical verbs are extremely common in the tweet conversations.

This illustrates what Crystal (cited in Thorne, 2003, p. 27) found about Twitter language, that “a new variant of English is emerging, a linguistic singularity a genuine new medium that is integral to the biggest language revolution ever.”

The most used part of speech in the personal category are adjectives, posting 83 counts or 15.01%, followed by the use of punctuation marks with a total of 57 tokenized words or 10.31%.

Although Twitter tweets are brief, they are sent so many times that in the aggregate, they could have an impact on linguistics.

Most often, organizations with causes and with a global reach prefer formal to informal language so that their intent would not be obscured or misunderstood.

Sun (2011) explains, twitters clip frequently used words and prefer shorter words or blend words to create new words.

The use of informal language is preferred in personal tweets because users want to develop and maintain longterm, mutually beneficial relationships with publics, according to Edman (2007).

Among the tweets analyzed, more posts utilized formal rather than informal language.

Of the Twitter users, high profile personalities such as President Benigno C. Aquino III, former US Vice President Al Gore and Undersecretary Manuel L. Quezon III employed formal language in their tweets.

Moreover, global organizations espousing specific causes utilized formal language.

Twitter can be used as a springboard to introduce language lessons that otherwise would have proved boring or uninteresting to students.

It behooves the creative language teacher to employ all possible strategies to transform classroom language learning into a more interactive activity.
