One sequence of the development of the modern corpus is that we can now for the first time undertake serious quantitative work in the field of grammar.

Quantitative studies require very large population to work with.

 >This is obvious in lexis, where the underlying principles of the frequency distribution of lexical items have been known for quite some time: if we want to investigate any words other than those of highest frequency in a language, we nee text data running at least into millions of words, and preferably into hundreds of millions.

In other words, I wanted to know the probabilities that were associated with these grammatical choices.

When I wrote my first sketch of a grammar of Chinese (1956), I attached probabilities to most of the primary systems.

 >The values were derived mainly from my own knowledge of the language, backed up from two sources: a small amount of counting of grammatical options in modern Chinese dramatic texts; and the work that I had subsequently been doing on a text in early Mandarin, the fourteenth-century Chinese version of the Secret History of the Mongols, in which I had counted every instance of those grammatical categories that I had been able to resolve into systems

Any concern with grammatical probabilities makes sense only in the context of a paradigmatic model of grammar, one that incorporates the category of system in its technical sense as defined by Firth.1

 >The *system*, in Firth's system-structure theory, is the category which models paradigmatic relations: just as a structure, in Firth's specialized use of the term, is a deep syntagm, so to speak, so a system is a deep paradigm. we could say that the element "Finite operator" in the structure of the English verb (verbal group) is given value by the systems of verbal deixis (temporal / modal) and polarity (positive / negative) which originate there.

What I hoped to do was to model each system not just as "choose a or b or c\ but as "choose a or b or c with a certain probability attached to each".

At this time a very sharp distinction was being drawn in linguistics between the system and the instance (the text), or between competence and performance; and quantitative effects were dis-missed as "merely performance features", so very few people were interested in this sort of study (and there was certainly no question of anyone publishing the results!).

Meanwhile in the 1960s the foundations were being laid for an eventual breakthrough in our understanding of linguistic systems, both qualitatively and quantitatively: namely the beginning of corpus-based linguistics.

The "corpus" had been the brainchild of two leading specialists in English linguistics: Randolph Quirk, in Britain, and Freeman Twaddell in the United States.

By the 1970s the corpus was well established as a research resource, and was being extended into the domain of language education, both as a resource for foreign-language learning, and as a theoretical basis for work in initial literacy

For example, while all mothers used a great deal of reasoning, middle-class and working-class mothers tended to favor different kinds of grounding for their explanations; while mothers of boys differed from mothers of girls in the ways in which they elaborated on their answers to their

Anyone who has tried to write a grammar, or a part of one, in computable form (and that means more or less any grammarian, these days, because thanks to Chomsky we have a much stronger sense of commitment to making our grammars explicit) is aware of the triviality trap: that the easier a thing is to recognize, the less it is worthwhile recognizing it.

In principle: all major clauses choose for polarity, whether finite or non-finite; whereas only finite clauses have primary tense, and not all of those because some finite clauses select modal and not temporal deixis. Furthermore, of those that select temporal deixis there are some which select neither past nor present but future."
