However, the process and causal mechanisms of word-of-mouth advertising have not really been given much attention

Previous research on personal influence has been more concerned with the influencers (the opinion leaders) than with those influenced

The conceptual framework was applied in a field experiment, which was designed to limit the normal dif- fusion time to 16 days to aid respondent recall of word- of-mouth activity.

This study's objective was to investigate how product- related conversations affect short-term purchasing be- havior.

In the inter- views, information was also collected on social, psycho- logical, and purchasing-consumption variables.

Seventy-two percent of the comments received were concerned with the coupon and the worthiness of buying the product. Twenty percent mentioned the taste and flavor of the product.

Over time, the number of taste and flavor comments increased, while the share of coupon comments decreased.

The main flow of word of mouth went between persons who, at the time of talking, had not made a purchase, with word of mouth being more likely to flow from buyers to nonbuyers.

Instead, the informal communicators declared their opinions of the product and the deal. Analysis of the comments gave little evidence of any direct two-step flow of communication in the sense that information from outside the social system (the apartment complex community) was relayed by word of mouth, though the cover letter and coupon appeared to have started much word of mouth; the appeals and sell- ing points of the letter, in-store display material, and the package were discussed only to a small extent.

It was thus hypothesized that exposure to favorable word of mouth would aid acceptance of the new prod- uct, while unfavorable word of mouth would hinder it. Though the respondents were eight times as likely to receive favorable as unfavorable word of mouth, the results suggest that unfavorable word of mouth was more effective.

Because of the small number of respondents (only 11) reporting unfavorable word-of-mouth pressure, this finding should be carefully interpreted

The curves have a striking resemblance with patterns found in drug studies at Columbia Uni- versity [3, 4]. Similar results were obtained for many choices received as "person with whom likely to discuss new food products" and "person who more often than others volunteers information."

Wives well integrated into the social structures were faster to adopt the new product than were the isolated residents

A third possibility is that the influence of sociometric status came as role expectations for the opinion leaders

Table 2 shows that respondents receiving sociometric choices were significantly more likely to receive favor- able word of mouth than were their more isolated as- sociates.

it may then be concluded that more word-of-mouth activity contributed to the earlier adoption by the well-integrated wives.

In conceiving of perceived risk as applied here, there are two main risk components-importance and un- certainty. This concept was proposed by Cunningham [5].

To cope with the hazards of perceived risk, consumers tend to develop risk-handling tactics.

One such tactic would be repeated purchase of the same brand, thus avoiding new untried brands. A more active tactic would be to seek additional information from many sources including word of mouth.

The results showed that, compared with the low-risk perceivers, high-risk perceivers were more brand loyal and less likely to buy private label brands

It was thus hypothesized that the high-risk perceivers would be less likely to purchase the new product.

Moreover, the buyers high in risk were more likely to have postponed the pur- chase until near the end of the test period.

Other results in this study showed that the high-risk perceivers tended to make more effort to seek word-of- mouth information.

Word of mouth seemed to flow from the low- to the high-risk perceivers [1]. It was predicted that word of mouth would have more impact on the high-risk perceivers.

The "impact of word of mouth pressure" was operationally defined as the dif- ference in proportion of buyers between the favorable and unfavorable pressure groups.

Those high riskers appeared to pay more attention to what they heard, particularly to unfavorable comments.

The inner-other-directedness variable is derived from Riesman's theoretical formulations [8].

It was then hypothesized that the other-directed peo- ple would be particularly likely to make use of the word- of-mouth channels.

Indirect influences, such as the awareness that many of their friends bought the new product, may have been important

The decision process of other-directed people may be more characterized by observation and emulation of buying behavior of other persons than by seeking word-of-mouth information.

Degree of sociometric integration was re- lated both to the likelihood of early purchase and of receiving favorable word of mouth.

The comments tended to reflect exchanges of opinion more than attempts to control the purchasing actions of the receivers of word of mouth.

Perhaps the word-of-mouth process, as found here, may be best explained as seeking social support for adoption or non-adoption and as risk reduction by group action.

The main flow of word of mouth went between would-be buyers, who seemed to tell each other: "If you'll buy, I'll buy."

###Summary

1. The Word-of-Mouth spreads more often in the none-buyers, which echoes the post-decision concept.

2. The unfavourable WoM is more effective, which echoes the inference that the bad news transferred faster than good news.

3.People well integrated into the social network would be more efficient to take advantage of new information, which suggests that the better you involve in Twitter, the more likely you will obtain good information.

4. Also, "the more word-of-mouth activity contributed to the earlier adoption", which implies that the more users you follow on Twitter, the more likely you will obtain the helpful information.

5. For avoiding the potential risks, customers would develop some tactics. For example, they would insist buying the same brand products, or they may involve more discussions about new products. In the stock market, we can see a striking resemblance: investors may concentrate on a number of fixed tickers, or they are willing to receive more discussions about the new tickers. They are more careful to deal with new tickers or bad news.

6. "The buyers high in risk were more likely to have postponed the purchase until near the end of the test period", but they are "more brand loyal and less likely to buy private label brands", because they are willing to receive more information.

7. He uses the likelihood of early purchase and of receiving favourable WoM to evaluate the sociometric integration.

8. Arndt points out the WoM should be better considered as "seeking social support for adoption or non-adoption and as a rick reduction of group action".
