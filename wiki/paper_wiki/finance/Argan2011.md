In marketing literature, word of mouth (WOM) is generally employed to illustrate advice from other experienced people.

According to Goyette et al. (2010), over the past years, WOM has been the object of multiple studies in marketing discipline.

**Many people tend to invest stock market when their social groups have high participation rate into the stock market and they conclude word-of-month interaction might cause a possible relationship between individual and social groups investment behavior.**

we have an assumption in the current paper that an investors who live in the same city are likely to come into direct contact with another through following ways such as read the local newspaper, watch a local TV, local investors conference and other similar events.

Thus this paper perhaps most naturally motivated to capture much more word-of-month communication evidences by focusing on the one local city investors.

The current paper underline that we cannot draw a certain pattern for investors on their standard portfolio choice decision and we cannot always assumes that the investors are rational and make their portfolio choice decision based on maximizing their utility.

The results showed that constructs related to word-of-mouth in stock exchange could be conceptualized and measured as a three-dimensional construct comprising experimental information, communication skills and, technical expertise.

Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed that majority of the constructs are having acceptable reliability and validity scores.

This study also revealed that financial stock investors do use word-of-mouth on stocks during purchase process and they predominantly circulate information on experimental information, communication skills, and technical financial expertise.

Stock investors may shape their decision about some notable stocks based on informal communication or advise efforts.

###Summary

Argan, Sevil, Yalama (2011) use a questionnaire method to investigate the investor in the same city. They confirmed the existence of the Word-of-Mouth in the stock market, which is constructed of three elements: experimental information, communication skills, and technical financial expertise. Furthermore, they note that the investors may rely more on the "informal communication or advise efforts".
