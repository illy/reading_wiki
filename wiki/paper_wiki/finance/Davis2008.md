WOM has been formally defined as â€˜all informal communications directed at other consumers about the ownership, usage, or characteristics of particular goods and services or their sellers' (Westbrook 1987).

The difference between traditional WOM and online WOM is that the communication in online WOM takes place in an anonymous asynchronous online environment. Online WOM allows consumers to share both negative and positive opinions and experiences from multiple sources (Chatterjee 2001). However, online WOM has an advantage over traditional WOM due to its potential to reach more consumers quite rapidly.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of online WOM on e-commerce multi-product sales and our ability to predict changes in sales attributable to various aspects of online WOM.

 >Specifically our research addresses the following question: What attributes of online WOM can be used to predict e-commerce sales?
WOM relies on information that is communicated about companies, products, or services among consumers.

In this online environment, the personal ties are always weak due to the fact that the person who wrote the review and the person relying on the review do not have a personal relationship (Chatterjee 2001).

Furthermore, previous research has clearly demonstrated that the notions of volume and valence are two of the most important WOM attributes (Amblee and Bui 2007a, Liu 2006).

Thus, the more conversation in the form of online comments there is about a product, the more likely someone will be informed about it, i.e., there is increased awareness of the product (Godes and Mayzlin 2004).

Furthermore, there is some evidence to suggest that valence is the best predictor of sales among all of the WOM attributes (Dellarocas et al. 2004).

We define visual cues as any image (a form of communication) posted by a reviewer and directed at other consumers when evaluating the characteristics of a particular good or service.

Online reviews originate from various sources and are generally provided by either expert reviewers or individuals who have had either a very negative or very positive experience (Clemons et al. 2006).

Smith et al. (2005) in particular suggest that peer reviews (or recommendations) are the most preferred by consumers.

The particular review system used by the subject organization filters product reviews as do other review systems (Awad and Zhang 2006). This is to say that all reviews related to product quality are posted, including negative ones. However, reviews are filtered to exclude any comments related to price, customer service issues, and other non-product quality data.

The statistical analysis of our initial conceptual model shows that the main effects for online WOM attributes, visual cues and volume, and moderator variables product category and product views are statistically significant (p<0.05) predictors of the number of products sold.

The refined model: The main effect for the online WOM attribute, volume, is not significant by itself in explaining variances in product sales.

Based on our findings it can be concluded that the interaction of product category and volume is more important for multi-product e-commerce sites.

Thus, product pages that include reviewer submitted images are not by themselves enough to effect product sales.

These results suggest that, in general, product pages with a higher number of customer views will produce a higher number of purchases.

Clearly, many of the product categories with images seem to have higher sales.

This implies that the type of product (category) by itself is not an important factor in predicting e-commerce product sales.

However, we do show that the interaction of products category and volume (i.e. number of comments about a product) has a significant effect on product sales (i.e. Hypothesis 4.1 is supported) and the product category does not moderate the relationship between visual cues and product sales (i.e. Hypothesis 4.2 is not supported).

One of the most important implications for practice is the idea that e-commerce companies need to have a strategy of combining efforts to increase product views and the volume of comments on specific product pages.

Our research confirms and provides a better under-standing of previous conclusions about the attributes of online WOM and its potential impact on product sales and also puts into play the notion that there are other factors (i.e. product views and categories) that influence multi-product e-commerce sales and work in conjunction with online WOM attributes such as visual cues and volume.

###Summary

Davis & Khazanchi (2008) produce an empirical study of online word-of-mouth effect, and their results reject some previous hypotheses. Basically, WOM is built on the consumers\' opinions about the product or service, and the main differences between online word-of-mouth and traditional one are the anonymousness and the spread speed. According to their research, the main contributions to WOM, such as volume, visual cues, valence and reviewer type do not affect online e-commerce significantly. Moreover, they indicate that there is a positive relationship between the number of the product review and the sales, which echoes Duan, Gu, & Whinston's research (2008).
