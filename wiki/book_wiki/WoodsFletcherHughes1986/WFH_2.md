The __aim__ is to reduce detail to a minimum while retaining sufficient information to communicate the essential characteristics of the original.

Remember always that _the use of data ought to enrich and elucidate the linguistic argument_, and this can often be done quite well by means of a simple table or diagram.

All the values between the minimum and maximum actually observed are possible and provision must be made for all of them on the bar chart, including any which do not actually appear in the data set.

Histogram:

1. No gaps left between the rectangles, it being assumed by convention that each class will contain all those scores greater than, or equal to, the lower bound of the interval but less than the value of the lower bound of the next interval.

2. Provided the class intervals are equal, the height of each rectangle corresponds to the frequency of each class.

3. As in the case of the bar chart, relative frequencies may be used to construct the histogram, this entailing only a change of scale on the vertical axis.

4. Great care has to be taken not to draw a mistaken diagram when the class intervals are not all of the same size - a good reason for choosing them to be equal.

Remember always that the __major purpose of the table or graph__ is to communicate the data more easily without distorting its general import.

It is worth reiterating that the purpose of such simple summaries is to promote _a rapid understanding of the main features of the data_, and it goes without saying that no summary method should be used if it obscures the argument or covers serious deficiencies in the data.
