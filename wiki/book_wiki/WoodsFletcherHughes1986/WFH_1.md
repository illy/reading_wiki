As we will demonstrate throughout the book, statistics allows us to __summarize__ complex numerical data and then, if desired, to __draw inferences__ from them.

The need to summarize and infer comes from the fact that _there is a variation in the numerical values associated with the data_.

Of course, the ultimate interest of linguistics investigators is not in the performance only of samples. They usually wish to generalize to the performance of larger groups.

These two examples hint at the kind of contribution statistics can and should make to linguistics studies, in summarizing data, and in making inferences from them.

For a developmental study like this we have to decide whether the data will be collected longitudinally or cross-sectionally.
