#Chapter 1 Introduction

##The social web and searchable talk

###Social web and social media

This kind of **discourse tagging** is the beginning of *searchable talk*, a change in social relations whereby we mark our discourse so that it can be found by others, in effect so that we can bond around particular values (Zappavigna 2011b). (p1)

In other words, **virtual groupings** afforded by features of electronic text, such as metadata, create alignments between people who have not necessarily directly interacted online. (p1)

The social web, or **web 2.0**, are popularized terms used to signal a shift toward the internet as *interpersonal resource* rather than solely an informational network. (p2)

In other words, the social web is about using the internet to **enact relationships** rather than simply share information, although the two functions are clearly interconnected. (p2)

The advent of social media, technology that aims to support ambient interpersonal connections, has placed new and interesting **semiotic pressure** on language.

**Social media** is an umbrella term generally applied to web-based service that facilitate some form of social interaction or 'networking'.

 >1. Websites where the design-principle is explicitly about allowing users to create and develop online relationships with 'friends' or 'followers'.

 >2. Platforms where the focus is on generating and sharing content. (p2)

They can be somewhat of a 'moving target' for scholars(Hogan and Quan-Haase 2010). (p3)

###About the book

The method adopted in this book for exploring this patterning combines quantitative analysis of a large 100 million word corpus of microposts, HERMES< with a qualitative social semiotic approach to discourse analysis. (p3)

###Twitter and tweet

**Hashtags** are an emergent convention for labelling the topic of a micropost and a form of metadata incorporated into posts. (p1)

This content is public and searchable unless the user actively makes his or her account private. (p3)

In addiction, Twitter collects supplementary metadata about a tweet. (p3)

While most of the metadata collected by Twitter is not presented directly to the general user, a notable exception is hashtag. (p3)

These tags, a kind of in-text tagging visible within the body of a tweet, arose out of community use and were later incorporated into Twitter's search interface.
