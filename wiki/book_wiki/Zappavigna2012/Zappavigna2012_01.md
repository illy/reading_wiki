#Chapter 1 Introduction

##1.1The social web and searchable talk

###Social web and social media

This kind of **discourse tagging** is the beginning of *searchable talk*, a change in social relations whereby we mark our discourse so that it can be found by others, in effect so that we can bond around particular values (Zappavigna 2011b). (p1)

In other words, **virtual groupings** afforded by features of electronic text, such as metadata, create alignments between people who have not necessarily directly interacted online. (p1)

The social web, or **web 2.0**, are popularized terms used to signal a shift toward the internet as *interpersonal resource* rather than solely an informational network. (p2)

In other words, the social web is about using the internet to **enact relationships** rather than simply share information, although the two functions are clearly interconnected. (p2)

The advent of social media, technology that aims to support ambient interpersonal connections, has placed new and interesting **semiotic pressure** on language. (p2)

**Social media** is an umbrella term generally applied to web-based service that facilitate some form of social interaction or 'networking'.

 >1. Websites where the design-principle is explicitly about allowing users to create and develop online relationships with 'friends' or 'followers'.

 >2. Platforms where the focus is on generating and sharing content. (p2)

They can be somewhat of a 'moving target' for scholars(Hogan and Quan-Haase 2010). (p3)

Perhaps the most commonly used form of social media is the **social networking service** (SNS). SNSs are services with which users create an online profile about themselves with the foal of connecting with other people and being 'findable'. (p5)

Indeed, interactions via social media are usually linked to some form conversation. (p5)

Depending on the kind of relationship being construed, the 'dialogue' may be fairly limited, often involving two main avenues: making initial contact with a user and then maintaining occasional contact at important dates, such as birthday (2010). (p5)

Most SNSs have in common a number of basic functions: profile creation, the ability to generate a list of affiliates of affiliated users. (p5) 

Four affordances boyd suggests are of particular significance:

 >1. persistence (capture and archiving of content);

 >2. replicability (duplication of content);

 >3. scalability (broad visibility of content);

 >4. searchability (access to content via search). (p5)

###About the book

The method adopted in this book for exploring this patterning combines quantitative analysis of a large 100 million word corpus of microposts, HERMES with a qualitative social semiotic approach to discourse analysis. (p3)

The theme trying these studies together is 'ambient affiliation': how social bonds are realized in language, in particular, the emerging searchable talk of microblogging. (p14)

###Twitter and tweet

The extremely large volume of naturally occurring language is of great interest, as data to linguist. (p4)

This content is public and searchable unless the user actively makes his or her account private. (p3)

In addiction, Twitter collects supplementary metadata about a tweet. (p3)

 >Folks were tweeting 5000 times a day in 2007. By 2008, that number, was 300,000, and by 2009 it had grown to 2.5 million per day. Tweets grew 1,400% last year to 3.5 million per day. Today, we are seeing 50 million per day - that's an average of 600 tweets per second. (Weil 2010) (p4)

The large volume of data made publicly available by these services offers a fascinating window on social life, though it also raises a range of ethical concerns about how this data is used (Parrish 2010). (p5)

####Hashtag

**Hashtags** are an emergent convention for labelling the topic of a micropost and a form of metadata incorporated into posts. (p1)

While most of the metadata collected by Twitter is not presented directly to the general user, a notable exception is hashtag. (p3)

These tags, a kind of in-text tagging visible within the body of a tweet, arose out of community use and were later incorporated into Twitter's search interface. (p3)

####Real-time

An important property of the social web is how it responds to time. Social media content is most often chronologically displayed. (p4)

Indeed, many commentators describe the emergence of a '**real-time**' web; that is, a *paradigm* whereby web content is streamed to users via syndication.(p4)

This type of convergent, real-time web experience combines with the social web to produce a semiotic world in which users at any given time. (p4)

Even local, less significant events, such as weather, can trigger communal response. (p4)

Many other kinds of events generate widespread social media response, including natural disasters, and celebrity deaths. (p4)

An important function of social media is sharing experience of the everyday within this real-time paradigm. In microblogging this often involves bonding around collective complaint about life's little daily irritations. (p5)


##1.2 Interpersonal search

The advent of social media means that the function of online talk has become increasingly focused on negotiating and maintaining relationship. (p6)

From a semiotic perspective the **searchability** affords new forms of sociality.

**Interpersonal search**: the ability to use technology to find people so that you can bond around shared values (or clash over discordant ones!). (p6)

The notion of interpersonal search is a linguistic perspective on the concept of **social search** used within information science. (p6)

The term **social search** refers to a mode of searching that leverages a user's social network, for example, by asking a question on a social networking site. (p7)

The searchability is *particularly* useful for linguists collecting particular kinds of discourse, for example, online chatter about a particular topic or language occurring in a particular geographical region.(p6)

In popular terms, it is becoming increasingly useful to search the 'hive mind': the stream of online conversation occurring across semiotic modes.(p6)

Microblogging streams offer a way of finding out about dominant trends in what people are saying. (p6)

Recommendation and opinion questions were the *most frequent*; a **recommendation question** was defined as asking 'for a rating of a specific item' and an **opinion question** as 'open-ended request for suggestions' (Ringel, et al, 2010, p. 1742) (p7)

The *most common motivation* expressed by respondents for engaging in this form of social search was a higher perceived level of trust in their friends to provide replies to questions deemed too subjective to be effectively answered by a search engine. (p7)

Social bonds have becoming increasingly important in the way information is located and consumed with the Internet.(p7)

The significance of **interpersonal search** forms part of an explanation for the proliferation of social recommendation sites, social bookmarking, crowdsourcing and related practices that make use of the social opinions extractable from online networks.(p7)

##1.3 Approaches to online networks

The streams of online social contact produces by users leave permanent traces that can be captured and modelled by researchers trying to understand the properties of the social networks arising with these social media feeds.(p7)

The scope of networking practises seen with social media is immense. (p7)

1. Most studies of social media communities, particularly computationally oriented studies of microblogging communities, use some derivative of social network analysis (SNA). (Wasserman and Faust 1994). (p8)

2. Computationally, interest generally lies in trying to understand the properties of online social networks. (p8)

3. Alongside considering the shape of a social network is interest in how information travels through the network. (p8)

4. These notions of influence and authority five rise to theorizing how communal attention operates in social media. (p9)

5. Attention is also significant when thinking about social media in terms of its relationship to existing news media.

6. Practical application of research into online social networks include 'opinion mining' in marketing, which is concerned with determine consumer opinion about brands (Jansen et al, 2009) (p9)

##1.4 Language and affiliation in social media

Since forming and maintaining social bonds is one of the *main function* of language, it seems reasonable to conclude that linguistic analysis may offer a useful lens on how networks of interpersonal relationships are formed and maintained. (p9-10)

A linguistic perspective on virtual community aims to describe explicitly how people use language to construe social bonds by creating interpersonal meaning. (p10)

While studies of online discourse from a linguistic perspective are relatively established (Crystal 2006; Baron 2008; Herring 1996), whether analysis of linguistic function and structure can serve as evidence for defining online communities is an emergent area of inquiry. (p10)

Using linguistic as a lens on community means that we are using semiotic evidence to group instances of meaning-making, rather than simple using contextual speaker variables, such as age or geography. Evidence of this kind is important to ensuring that the classification is more than a folk categorization. (p10)

Some language-based research into social media communities has been begun by computational linguists in the area of sentiment analysis -- and natural language processing more generally. (p11)

##1.5 A social semiotic perspective

The perspective on **ambient bonding** applied in this book relies upon a social semiotic approach to language as it is used in its functional contexts (Halliday 1978). (p11)

The theory refers to the domain of meaning making associated with forging social bonds as **interpersonal meaning**. It is **interpersonal meaning** that builds and sustains online social network. (p12)

The language used in social media, particularly microblogging, is under significant interpersonal pressure. (p12)

 >1. It is deployed in a modality where interpersonal meanings that might otherwise be expressed paralinguistically must be expressed in other means.

 >2. On the other hand, it is bound by the need for linguistic economies arising from the character constraints imposed on microposts. (p12)

Coupling is also central to the view of community and affiliation proposed in this book. (p12)

In this book I focus on couplings of ideational and interpersonal meanings in memes, slang, humour and political discourse in microblogging in order to explore how these textual relations realize social relations, particularly the shift toward searchable talk as a bonding strategy. (p13)

This book will employ coupling theory to think about processes of affiliation with searchable talk as ongoing negotiation of couplings in text. (p13)
